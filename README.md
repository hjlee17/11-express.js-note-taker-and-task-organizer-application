To add a note, input directly into "Note Title" and "Note Text."  
As soon as the user has inputted text, a save icon will appear in the top right. Click this icon to save the task in the left column.  
If the user wishes to restart or start a new note, the + icon will clear both fields.  Also, after saving a task, the fields will automatically clear.  
If the user wants to view the details of any saved tasks, click on the task in the left column.  
(While reviewing saved tasks, if a user wants to write a new note, use the + icon.) 
Clicking the red delete icon will delete the task.
